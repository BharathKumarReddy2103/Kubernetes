# 🚀 From Docker to Kubernetes: A DevOps Engineer’s End-to-End Migration Guide. Kubernetes Implementation from Scratch to Production.

In this detailed guide, we’ll walk through the **real-world DevOps journey** of migrating a microservices-based architecture—originally deployed with Docker Compose on virtual machines—into a fully scalable, secure, and production-ready **Kubernetes setup**. Whether you're working on **AWS EKS**, **GKE**, or **Azure AKS**, this roadmap applies across platforms.

---

## 📌 Introduction

Imagine you've joined a large enterprise as a **DevOps Engineer**, and you're asked to migrate an entire microservices system (currently running on VMs via Docker Compose) to **Kubernetes**. This task involves:

- Designing the Kubernetes architecture from scratch  
- Planning environments (dev, staging, prod)  
- Managing resource allocation, namespaces, RBAC  
- Ensuring high availability and scaling  

This guide breaks down the journey into **6 practical levels** every DevOps engineer should follow for a successful Kubernetes onboarding.

## 🔍 Level 0: Requirement Gathering

Before writing a single Kubernetes manifest, gather critical information:

### ✅ 1. Identify Microservices  
Create a list of all microservices. Example for an e-commerce app:
- `payment-service`
- `shipping-service`
- `catalogue-service`
- `ui-service`
- `cart-service`

### ✅ 2. Identify Development Teams  
Group services by teams (e.g., Payments, UI, Logistics) for logical namespace isolation later.

### ✅ 3. Categorize Business Impact  
Group services into:
- Less critical  
- Medium importance  
- Important  
- Critical  

This prioritization helps phase the migration.

### ✅ 4. Resource Utilization  
Fetch CPU, Memory, Disk usage from:
- Prometheus & Grafana  
- AWS CloudWatch  
- Azure Monitor  

Use this to plan cluster sizing.

### ✅ 5. Cost Estimation  
Calculate current VM costs vs projected Kubernetes (EKS/AKS/GKE) costs using cloud provider billing dashboards and calculators.

📄 Maintain everything in a spreadsheet with:
- Service Name  
- Team  
- CPU/Memory usage  
- Business Criticality  
- Migration Priority  
- Cost Estimate  
- Environment Readiness

## 🧪 Level 1: Proof of Concept (PoC)

### 🔨 Goals:
- Test Kubernetes viability with ~15 microservices  
- Include stateful + stateless apps

### 🛠️ Actions:
- Create small Kubernetes cluster (e.g., 3 nodes x 8 CPU, 8GB RAM)
- Write `Deployment`, `Service`, `Ingress`, `StatefulSet` YAMLs
- Use cloud-native ingress (e.g., AWS ALB)
- Run tests with QA team
- Debug issues (e.g., CrashLoopBackOff)
  - Add `livenessProbe` and `readinessProbe`

🔁 Iterate until stability is achieved.

## 🏗️ Level 2: Dev Kubernetes Cluster

With PoC insights and sheet data:

### 🧱 Cluster Sizing:
- Example: Need 40 CPU, 60 GB RAM  
- Provision 3 worker nodes with slightly more (e.g., 3 × 16 CPU, 24 GB RAM)

### 🧩 Namespace Strategy:
Use **team-based namespaces**:
- `payments`
- `transactions`
- `ui`

### 🔐 RBAC Integration:
- Map teams to namespaces using RoleBindings
- Use OIDC for authentication

### 📊 Resource Quotas & Limits:
- Use `ResourceQuota` per namespace
- Use `limits` and `requests` per pod

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ResourceQuota
metadata:
  name: payments-quota
  namespace: payments
spec:
  hard:
    cpu: "8"
    memory: "16Gi"
````

## 🧪 Level 3: Staging Environment Setup

Two popular methods:

### Option A: Shared Cluster (with separate namespaces)

* Namespace: `dev-payments`, `stage-payments`
* RBAC needs to be tightly managed

### Option B: Separate Clusters

* Full isolation between dev and staging
* Preferred for stability and security

👨‍🔧 Tip: Use higher resource allocation in staging to match production traffic.

---

## 🔐 Level 4: Production Kubernetes Cluster

### Key Differentiators:

* **Multi-AZ Deployment**
* **High availability**
* **More aggressive autoscaling or Karpenter setup**

### Steps:

* Deploy control plane across 3 Availability Zones
* Spread worker nodes using topology constraints
* Use `topologySpreadConstraints` in Deployments

```yaml
topologySpreadConstraints:
- maxSkew: 1
  topologyKey: topology.kubernetes.io/zone
  whenUnsatisfiable: ScheduleAnyway
  labelSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: payment-service
```

* Integrate full observability stack (Prometheus, Grafana)
* Configure CI/CD pipelines (e.g., GitHub Actions + Argo CD)

---

## 🌐 Level 5: Global High Availability (Multi-Region)

For global user base:

* Deploy Kubernetes clusters in:

  * US (EKS)
  * Europe (AKS)
  * Asia (GKE)

* Use Global Load Balancer (e.g., AWS Route 53 + latency-based routing)

* Replicate microservices across clusters

* Ingress in each cluster routes based on geography

### Architecture Overview:

```text
[Client] --> [Route 53] --> [Ingress-US] --> [K8s-US Cluster]
                          --> [Ingress-Asia] --> [K8s-Asia Cluster]
                          --> [Ingress-Europe] --> [K8s-EU Cluster]
```

🛡️ Use this setup only when latency and global uptime matter most.

## 🛠️ Best Practices

* Start with a solid **requirement gathering document**
* Maintain a central **tracking sheet** for services and priorities
* Never skip the **PoC phase**
* Use **namespaces and RBAC** for secure access control
* Setup **observability and autoscaling** early
* Share the migration plan with **development and management teams**
* Evaluate **multi-region only when necessary** due to high costs

## 🎯 Conclusion

Migrating microservices from Docker Compose to Kubernetes is **not a one-day task**. It involves:

* Planning
* Proofing
* Testing
* Phased deployment
* Team collaboration

By following this 6-level roadmap, DevOps engineers can ensure a **scalable, secure, and production-ready Kubernetes setup**.
