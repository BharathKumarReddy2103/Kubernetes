When troubleshooting Kubernetes Pods, it's essential to use various tactics to diagnose and resolve issues. Here are some effective Kubernetes pod troubleshooting tactics:

**1. Check Pod Status**

     Use the kubectl get pods command to check the status of your pods:

 ```bash
    kubectl get pods
```

    If the pod is not running as expected, check if it is in a Pending, CrashLoopBackOff, or Error state.
