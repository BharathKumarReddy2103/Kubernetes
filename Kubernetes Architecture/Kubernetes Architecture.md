**Kubernetes Architecture Deep Dive**

Kubernetes (K8s) is a **container orchestration platform** that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It follows a **master-worker architecture**, where the control plane manages the cluster, and worker nodes run applications inside containers.

---

**1. High-Level Overview of Kubernetes Architecture**

Kubernetes consists of:

•	**Control Plane (Master Node)**

•	**Worker Nodes**

•	**Networking & Storage Components**

---

**2. Control Plane (Master Node)**

The control plane is responsible for managing the Kubernetes cluster and scheduling workloads. It includes several key components:

**a) API Server (kube-apiserver)**

•	Acts as the **entry point** to the Kubernetes cluster.

•	Exposes a **REST API** for communication between users, CLI (kubectl), and internal Kubernetes components.

•	Authenticates and validates requests before processing.

**b) Controller Manager (kube-controller-manager)**

•	Monitors the state of the cluster and ensures the desired state matches the actual state.

•	Includes various controllers:

o	**Node Controller** – Detects and replaces failed nodes.

o	**Replication Controller** – Ensures the correct number of pod replicas are running.

o	**Service Controller** – Manages service discovery and endpoint mapping.

o	**Job Controller** – Manages batch jobs and cron jobs.

**c) Scheduler (kube-scheduler)**

•	Assigns workloads (Pods) to the most suitable worker nodes.

•	Considers factors like resource availability, affinity rules, and taints/tolerations.

**d) etcd (Key-Value Store)**

•	A **distributed, consistent database** that stores the cluster’s configuration and state.

•	Used for leader election and maintaining a highly available cluster.

**e) Cloud Controller Manager (Optional)**

•	Allows Kubernetes to integrate with cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP).

•	Manages cloud resources like load balancers, storage, and networking.

---

**3. Worker Node Components**

Worker nodes are responsible for running containerized workloads. Each worker node includes:

**a) Kubelet**

•	The agent that runs on each worker node.

•	Communicates with the API server and ensures the assigned Pods are running.

•	Monitors pod health and reports to the control plane.

**b) Container Runtime**

•	Responsible for running containers inside Pods.

•	Examples: **Docker, containerd, CRI-O.**

**c) Kube Proxy**

•	Manages network communication between pods and services.

•	Implements Kubernetes Service networking using **iptables** or **eBPF**.

---

**4. Kubernetes Networking**

Kubernetes follows a **flat networking model**, where each Pod gets a unique IP address.

**a) Pod-to-Pod Communication**

•	All pods in a cluster can communicate without NAT.

•	Implemented via **CNI (Container Network Interface)** plugins like **Calico, Flannel, Cilium.**

**b) Service-to-Pod Communication**

•	Kubernetes **Services** provide stable IPs and load balancing.

•	Types of services:

o	**ClusterIP** (default) – Internal communication.

o	**NodePort** – Exposes services externally on each node’s IP.

o	**LoadBalancer** – Uses a cloud provider’s load balancer.

o	**ExternalName** – Maps to an external DNS name.

**c) Ingress Controller**

•	Manages HTTP/S traffic into the cluster.

•	Implements routing rules based on domain names or paths.

•	Examples: **NGINX Ingress, Traefik, HAProxy.**

---

**5. Storage in Kubernetes**

Kubernetes provides **persistent storage** for stateful applications.

**a) Volume Types**

•	**EmptyDir** – Ephemeral storage tied to a Pod’s lifecycle.

•	**HostPath** – Directly mounts the host’s filesystem.

•	**PersistentVolume (PV) & PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC)** – Decouples storage from pods.

•	**Storage Classes** – Dynamic provisioning of storage.

b) **StatefulSets**

•	Used for stateful applications like databases.

•	Provides **stable network identities and persistent storage.**

---

**6. Workload Resources**

Kubernetes provides different workload objects:

**a) Pods**

•	Smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes.

•	Contains one or more containers sharing storage and network.

**b) Deployments**

•	Manages stateless applications.

•	Provides rolling updates and rollbacks.

**c) ReplicaSets**

•	Ensures a fixed number of pod replicas are running.

**d) DaemonSets**

•	Ensures a pod runs on every node (e.g., for logging or monitoring agents).

**e) Jobs & CronJobs**

•	Used for batch processing and scheduled tasks.

**f) ConfigMaps & Secrets**

•	**ConfigMaps** – Stores non-sensitive configuration.

•	**Secrets** – Stores sensitive data (encrypted).

---

**7. Kubernetes Security**

**a) Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**

•	Defines permissions using **Roles and RoleBindings.**

•	Cluster-wide access is managed using **ClusterRoles and ClusterRoleBindings.**

**b) Network Policies**

•	Defines rules for **Pod communication** using labels and selectors.

**c) Pod Security**

•	SecurityContext enforces **privileged access, capabilities, and user permissions.**

**d) Service Mesh (Istio, Linkerd)**

•	Provides **mutual TLS encryption, traffic control, and observability.**

---

**8. Kubernetes Logging & Monitoring**

**a) Logging**

•	Logs are collected from Pods using tools like **Fluentd, Loki, or EFK Stack (Elasticsearch + Fluentd + Kibana).**

**b) Monitoring**

•	**Prometheus + Grafana** for real-time monitoring.

•	**cAdvisor** collects container resource metrics.

---

**9. Kubernetes Cluster Deployment Methods**

•	**Minikube** – Single-node cluster for local testing.

•	**Kubeadm** – Sets up a production-grade cluster.

•	**Managed Kubernetes Services:**

o	Amazon EKS

o	Azure AKS

o	Google GKE

o	Rancher, OpenShift

---

**10. Kubernetes Scaling & High Availability**

**a) Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)**

•	Scales pods based on CPU/memory usage.

**b) Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA)**

•	Adjusts resource requests/limits dynamically.

**c) Cluster Autoscaler**

•	Adds or removes worker nodes based on demand.

---

**Conclusion**

Kubernetes provides a **robust, scalable, and flexible** architecture for deploying containerized applications. Understanding its core components - **Control Plane, Worker Nodes, Networking, Storage, and Security**—is essential for efficient cluster management.
