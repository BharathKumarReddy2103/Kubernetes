**Conventional Pipeline vs. Kubernetes Pipeline in DevOps**

Both **Conventional Pipeline** and **Kubernetes Pipeline** are CI/CD workflows used in DevOps for deploying applications, but they differ in their architecture, deployment methodology, and scalability.

**1. Conventional Pipeline (Traditional Deployment)**

In a **Conventional Pipeline**, the deployment process follows a more traditional approach where applications are deployed on physical servers or virtual machines (VMs).

**Workflow:**

**1.	Code Commit** – Developers push code to a version control system like GitHub.

**2.	Build & Test** – A CI/CD tool runs tests and builds the application.

**3.	Artifact Storage** – The build artifacts (binaries) are stored in an artifact repository like Nexus Artifactory or S3 
      Bucket.

**4.	Dev Deployment** – The new binary is pulled and deployed to a **Dev Environment** for testing.

**5.	QA Deployment** – If Dev tests pass, the application is deployed to the **QA Environment.**

**6.	Production Deployment** – Once QA testing is complete, the final application is deployed to the Production Environment.

**7.	Monitoring & Maintenance** – The production environment is monitored for performance and issues.

**Challenges of Conventional Pipeline:**

**•	Manual Deployments** – Moving from staging to production often requires human intervention.

**•	Slow Rollouts** – No advanced rollout strategies like blue-green or canary deployments.

**•	Infrastructure Dependencies** – Applications rely on specific VMs or servers, making scaling complex.

**•	Lack of Containerization** – Deployments are dependent on the host OS and software versions.

**2. Kubernetes Pipeline (Modern Cloud-Native Deployment)**

A **Kubernetes Pipeline** modernizes the CI/CD process using containerized applications, orchestrated via Kubernetes.

**Workflow:**

**1.	Code Commit** – Developers push code to a version control system like GitHub.

**2.	Build & Test** – A CI/CD tool runs tests and builds the application.

**3.	Container Image Storage** – Instead of storing binaries, a **Docker Image** is pushed to a container registry.

**4.	Kubernetes Configuration** – A Kubernetes configuration file (YAML) defines how the container should be deployed.

**5.	Dev Deployment** – A new container image is pulled and deployed to a Dev Cluster.

**6.	QA Deployment** – After testing, the image is deployed to a **QA Cluster**.

**7.	Rollout Strategy** – Kubernetes enables advanced rollout strategies:

o	**Blue-Green Deployment** – Two production environments run side by side, allowing traffic switching between old and new versions.

o	**Canary Deployment** – The new version is deployed to a small percentage of users before full rollout.

**8.	Production Deployment** – Once tested, the image is deployed to the Production Cluster.

**9.	Monitoring & Maintenance** – Kubernetes provides built-in monitoring tools for better visibility.

**Advantages of Kubernetes Pipeline:**

•	**Containerization** – Applications are deployed in containers, making them independent of the host OS.

•	**Automated Rollouts** – Kubernetes automates deployment processes with minimal human intervention.

•	**Scalability** – Kubernetes dynamically scales applications based on demand.

•	**Flexible Rollouts** – Blue-Green and Canary deployments reduce downtime and risk.

•	**Infrastructure Agnostic** – Works across cloud providers and on-premise environments.

**Key Differences Between Conventional and Kubernetes Pipelines**

| Feature               | Conventional Pipeline             | Kubernetes Pipeline             |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| **Artifact Storage**  | Stores binaries in JFrog Artifactory | Stores container images in a Docker registry |
| **Deployment Type**   | VMs or physical servers         | Kubernetes clusters             |
| **Testing Environments** | Staging, QA, and Production on VMs | Staging, QA, and Production on Kubernetes |
| **Rollout Strategy**  | Manual deployments             | Automated with Blue-Green & Canary |
| **Scalability**       | Limited, requires manual intervention | Auto-scaling with Kubernetes  |
| **Infrastructure Dependence** | Tied to specific VMs/servers | Works across different cloud providers |
| **Monitoring & Maintenance** | Manual monitoring         | Built-in Kubernetes monitoring  |

**Conclusion**

A **Conventional Pipeline** is suitable for traditional applications that run on VMs and require manual intervention. In contrast, a **Kubernetes Pipeline** is ideal for cloud-native applications, offering automation, scalability, and seamless deployments.

For modern DevOps practices, Kubernetes pipelines provide more flexibility, reduce downtime, and allow for automated rollouts, making them the preferred choice for microservices and cloud-native applications.
